### Machine Learning Intern at Apollo, Baidu USA (Sept. 2021 - Dec. 2021)
Interaction in Autonomous Driving
- Propose and implement the rule-based control point decider and gap decider, when the autonomous vehicle is in the unprotected left turn scenario at the intersection. They increases the efficiency of unprotected left turn.
- Implement a prototype reinforcement learning model (DQN) by Libtorch to determine the control point and gap to pass. Prove the feasibility of RL in unprotected left turn.
