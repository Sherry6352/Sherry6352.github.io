## Teaching

I served as a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for Undergraduate Public Economics (ECON131) with Emmanuel Saez in Spring 2019. 

- *I was awarded the Outstanding GSI Award (given to the top 10% of GSis in the department).*   

Current lecture notes for that course can be found [here](https://eml.berkeley.edu//~saez/course131/course131.html).
